 Recommendations (Building on Your Report)
- Subscription Strategy
- Since subscribers are more loyal, introduce tiered benefits (exclusive previews, faster shipping, loyalty points).
- Target non-subscribers with personalized offers to convert them.
- Female Customer Engagement
- Female customers spend less overall. Consider targeted campaigns (bundles, fashion-focused promotions, influencer tie-ins) to boost engagement.
- Discount Optimization
- Discounts are driving high-value purchases. Instead of reducing them, strategically apply discounts to products with lower ratings to improve adoption.
- Product Positioning
- Highlight top-rated products (Gloves, Sandals, Boots) in- marketing campaigns.
- Cross-sell accessories with clothing to increase basket size.
- Age-Based Targeting
- Younger customers are leading in revenue. Use social media campaigns and gamified loyalty programs to strengthen this segment.
- For seniors, emphasize ease of use, trust, and comfort-focused products.
